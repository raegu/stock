üíπPredication of Reliance Stock Price Project.


<h3>Hey Folks,üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</h3>
<p>I have created a stock market price prediction program that can predict the stock price of any company for the next 30 days. Here I used the last 7 years' data of Reliance Industries Limited. I did this project during my internship</p>

<h2>Description of the project:</h2>
<h4>Business Objective of the project</h4>

- Predict the Reliance Industries Stock Price for the next 30 days.

- There are Open, High, Low and Close prices that you need to obtain from the web for each day starting from 2015 to 2022 for Reliance Industries stock.

- Split the last year into a test set- to build a model to predict stock price.

- Find short term, & long term trends.

- Understand how it is impacted from external factors or any big external events.

- Forecast for next 30 days.
